FILES:

variable importance and optimization: finds most important variable and the bound for where it influences the response variable the most and plots it

optimizing with confidence intervals: following knowing what most important variable is, uses the confidence interval approach to find optimal values

multiple treatment comparisons: multiple comparisons for different treatments/determing which improves response the most

predicting response with recomendations: predicts treatment response following recomendations for optimal values found from previous files with confidence intervals

steady state analysis: finds data window where data is at a steadt state

SCPCA PPCA: code for getting the SCPCA+PPCA for microbial comunity analysis NOTE, PPCA is in the R package PoissonPCA

differing performance plots: finds windows where two treatments have significantly different results

partial_correlation: partial correlation function for measuring partial correlation of a dataset, i.e. the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables after statistically controlling for the effect of one or more other variables
